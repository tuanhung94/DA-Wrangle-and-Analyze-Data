# Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree Program - Project 07 : Wrangle and Analyze WerateDogs dataset
## Introduction
In this project, we will combine everything that has been taught in Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree Program to perform an end-to-end data analysis process for WerateDogs' Twitter archive dataset. More specifically, we will follow a standard workflow from data gathering, assessing and cleaning, to analyzing and finally visualizing our dataset to reveal some hidden insights. Further details as below:
### Part 1: Data Wrangling
- Data are gathered from 3 separate sources: a pre-existing csv file of WeRateDogs dataset, a tsv file downloaded from Udacity server which contains tweet image predictions of dog breeds, and a json dataset that contains retweet and favorite count information. 
- All these 3 datasets are assessed thoroughly to identify any tidiness and quality issues that would need to be addressed. They are later put to an exhaustive cleaning effort before the datasets can finally be merged together into a single one for further analysis.
### Part 2: Storing, Analyzing and Visualizing Data
- By utilizing Pandas library, we perform some analysis on our wrangled dataset, then plot our results to bar charts so other people can have a better idea of what we are trying to accomplish.
### Part 3: Reporting
- Our data wrangling as well as analyzing and visualizing efforts in Part 1 & 2 are fully documented and explained in two written reports: wrangle_report.pdf and act_report.pdf. The first one concerning our work in part 1 is intended to be an internal document, whereas the second one on visualizations and insights gained from our analysis is geared towards third-party viewers.
